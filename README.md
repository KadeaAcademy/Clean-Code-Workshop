# Clean-Code-Workshop

This is the source for the clean code workshop's slide deck that I ran at [Kinshasa Digital Academy](https://kinshasadigital.academy) for the 2021 session.

You need [Marpit Markdown](https://marpit.marp.app/markdown) to generate the slide decks. The easiest way to do so in my opition is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_841432) with the [Marp for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode).
